A twitter app clone created for Week 1 of Code Fellows' iOS Development accelerator.  More information can be found on http://www.codefellows.org

Day by day tasks for the app:

Monday:

- Create groups in your project for the model, view, and controller layer of your app
- Successfully parse the provided JSON file into Tweet model objects
- Add a table view to your view controller, and have it display all of the tweets that you parsed from the JSON

Tuesday

- Use the Accounts framework to get access to the user’s twitter account
- Use the social framework to fetch the users timeline
- Bake in status code checking into your network call and log out the status code
- Have your tableview display the user’s timeline once the network operation is completed back on the main thread
- Create a custom tableview cell class, and display the avatar image for each tweet in an image view on each cell

Wednesday:

- Create a network controller class that will be responsible for making all network calls to Twitter. The view controllers themselves should not be touching any URLS
- Create a second view controller called SingleTweetViewController that is devoted to just showing a single tweet, the user who tweeted it, and how many retweets and favorite it has. This view controller should be segued to when the user selects a cell from the home timeline.
- Move your image downloading to the network controller as well.
- Using autolayout on your custom cell, achieve dynamic cell height.  Check out this blog post to get you started with this particular feature: http://www.appcoda.com/self-sizing-cells/ (Links to an external site.)
